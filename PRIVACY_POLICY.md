## 1. Information We Collect

**Coixa Wallet is a client-side application.** We do **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal information or wallet data on our servers. All sensitive operations and data are performed and stored locally on your device.

### Types of Data Processed Locally

- **Wallet Data:** Your mnemonic phrase, private keys, and wallet details are generated and encrypted using a PIN you provide. These are stored only in your browser's local storage.
- **Account Information:** Public account IDs, balances, and transaction history are fetched directly from the Pi Network (via the Horizon API) and are not stored or transmitted to us.
- **Session Data:** Temporary session identifiers may be stored locally to maintain wallet access within your browser session.
- **Network Configuration:** Your selected Pi Network (Mainnet/Testnet) is stored locally for app functionality.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

- **Wallet Management:** Your encrypted wallet data is used to unlock and manage your Pi account.
- **Transaction Processing:** Public account information is retrieved from the Pi blockchain to display balances and transaction history.
- **Security:** All sensitive wallet data is encrypted with your PIN using industry-standard cryptography (AES with PBKDF2 key derivation). No private key or mnemonic is ever transmitted or exposed.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage Only:** All wallet data, session data, and settings are stored in your browser's local storage and never transmitted elsewhere.
- **Encryption:** Wallet data is encrypted using a secret PIN that only you know. If you lose your PIN or mnemonic, we cannot recover your wallet.

Coixa Wallet interacts with the Pi Network via the public Horizon API. No data is shared with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
